Final Project


Note that Github doesn't allow files of larger than 100mb to be uploaded. So I've only included the assets folder from my unity project. This includes the scripts, scenes, textures, and models I used.



Project title: Inkyâ€™s Spooky Maze Escape


Description: Play as the blue ghost Inky from Pac-man as you try to navigate the dark and scary maze where Pac-man lurks. Collect all the candy corn to reveal the candy canes that will destroy Pac-man.
